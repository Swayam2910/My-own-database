# My-own-database


A database is created using python which allows any user to store its daily record. It allows users to enter the following parameters:
1) Date
2) Number of hours studied
3) Number of hours doing exercise
4) Diet being followed
5) Earnings per day

The frontend is made using tkinter while backend is made using sqlite3 library which helps to connect easily to the database and use sql commands to access the data easily.

The codes for frontend and backend have been attached!
